customer inquiries, answers and communications resulting from such queries 
and related problems with the help of an array of tools and facilities 
clustered around the ticket management system like the knowledge base 
system, reminder system, mailing and messaging system, and email piping 
system to mention a few. </span></font><font color="#010101" ></font></div><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ><br></div><font color="#010101" ><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ></font><font face="Verdana"  color="#010101" ><span style="font-size:10pt" >The potential users of the system are users (customers), staffs (technicians), 
and administrators. </span></font><font color="#010101" ></font></div><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ><br></div><font color="#010101" ><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ></font><font face="Verdana"  color="#010101" ><span style="font-size:10pt" >Users/Customers communicate with the system to get their problems and 
questions solved. They usually look up in the relevant FAQ section to see 
whether a similar problem (and solution) is listed there already.&nbsp; If the user 
is not able to find a matching one, s/he posts a ticket with the necessary 
details. The staffs (technicians) respond to the tickets with a predefined 
reply or a newly created one, according to the situation. The main 
functionality of the system is this to and fro communication between the 
user and staff. In the case a staff is unable to resolve a problem s/he can 
escalate the problem to the administrator. </span></font><font color="#010101" ></font></div><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ><br></div><font color="#010101" ><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ></font><font face="Verdana"  color="#010101" ><span style="font-size:10pt" >Another major feature of iScripts Support System is LiveChat. Besides the 
ticket management system, customers can chat with the operators for any 
queries. Inter operator chat facility is also available in this system. If 
needed, customers can share their Computer Desktop with the operator 
whom they are chatting with through Remote Desktop Sharing feature. This 
will help them to solve their issues easily. Customers can select a particular 
department of the company and is able to chat with the staffs of that 
particular department. </span></font><font color="#010101" ></font></div><div align="left"  style="margin-left:13mm; margin-right:0mm; text-indent:0mm; " ><font color="#010101" ></font></div>
